### Lesson 1:

- select the Auto-enable Return Key checkbox
This change makes it impossible for the user to tap the Done key before typing text into the text field, ensuring that users can never enter an empty string as a meal name.
- The *outline view* — which appears on the left side of the canvas—lets you see a hierarchical representation of the objects in your storyboard.
- Within that hierarchy, views enclosed within a view are called *subviews*, and the parent view that encloses a view is called its *superview*.
- *intrinsic content size*: The minimum size needed to display all the content in a view without clipping or distorting that content.
